Overview of HEC on Linux
------------------------

There are 4 script files which you can use to build and maintain HEC

1) bldall.sh 	- makes all the Linux binaries
2) mvbin.sh  	- moves all the Linux binaries to the ${BLDROOT}/bin directory
3) wipe.sh   	- deletes all the Linux binaries
4) bldapps.sh   - builds the test application .RUN files
 
Mount the CD-ROM and copy the linux directory tree to your filesystem

	mount  /dev/cdrom  /root/cdrom
	cp -r  /root/cdrom/linux   ./hec
	umount /dev/cdrom

Once you have copied the linux directory tree from the CD to your harddrive, 
you will need to use the chmod command to make these scripts executable.

For example:

		chmod +x ./bldall.sh

Also, to run these scripts you will need to edit them so that $BLDROOT
environmental variable points to the linux directory ( i.e. the directory 
containing the bin, hasm, hecvm subdirectories ). 

For example:

		BLDROOT=/root/hec/linux

Building HEC
------------

From the ${BLDROOT} directory, run the following scripts in the order specified
		
		i) bldall.sh
		ii) mvbin.sh

This will build all the native Linux binaries and move them to the 
${BLDROOT}/bin directory. It may be a wise idea to add the ${BLDROOT}/bin
directory to your $PATH.

Taking HEC for a spin
---------------------

Go to the ${BLDROOT}/hasm/testapps and run the bldapps.sh script. This will
invoke the HASM assembler and assemble all the applications. 

If you want to assemble a HEC assembly source file, you will need to issue
a command similar to:

	..\..\bin\hasm  timedate.asm
	( in general,  path\hasm  asmfile.asm )

Note, you will need to issue this command from the directory containing the
assembly source file. In addition, you cannot prefix the file name.

	..\..\bin\hasm  ./timedate.asm   ( this is INVALID ) 

To run an application, you will need to issue a command similar to:

	..\..\bin\hecvm  timedate.RUN
