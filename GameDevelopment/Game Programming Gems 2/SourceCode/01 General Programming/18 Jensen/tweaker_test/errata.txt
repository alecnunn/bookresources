Errata
------

In the gem text there are some wrong references to the RTTI usage.
My type information code simulates the behaviour of RTTI's typeid(), so to validate this action 
I have deleted all usage of RTTI from the Tweaker! 

Here are the pros and cons of keeping my type information: 

Pros

  * Takes less space for the type information (only for classes that uses it)
  * One can add specific information to the TypeID_c class, i.e. way to store/load the type, 
    pointer to GUI control, etc.
    (With typeid we have to create a special mapping between type_info (or any part of it) and our 
    additional information to do this.)

Cons
  * Have to use macros for each unique type, while RTTI provides the type information automatically
