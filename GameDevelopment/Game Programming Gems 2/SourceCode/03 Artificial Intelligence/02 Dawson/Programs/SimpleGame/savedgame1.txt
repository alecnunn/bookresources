# At the top level all blocks have a name, an equals sign, and then a
# brace delimited block.
# Within each block the are label which are followed by an equals sign
# and then data. The data format for each label is label defined. The
# labels must be in a fixed order because I don't feel like writing
# a more complicated parser. The data for each label must not contain
# carriage returns new lines, or null characters. DOS EOF characters
# (Ctrl+Z) are probably a bad idea also.
# The standard blocks filled in by the input system are StartupData
# and FrameData.
# StartupData contains the random seed and any application specified
# custom data, in numbered blocks.
# FrameData contains the frame number (redundant, but handy for checking
