GFReadMe.txt - an overview of the code released with the
               article "The Game Framework" by Scott Patterson.

You should be able to find updates and more information about this
code at: www.gameframework.com

This demo is programmed to run under Win32 operating systems and 
a workspace file for Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 is included.  

Briefly, this code implements video driver switching as part of
a game framework.  Run the demo and navigate through the menus
until you pull up the system config menu (which is in the pause
menu of the game task).  Once in the system config menu you can
switch between D3D7, D3D8, and OpenGL.

Tasks, AVLayers, and LogicLayers all have unique code files and 
associated config code files.  Config code files are used for
load-time configuration of objects and are only needed temporarily.

Some files do not have implementations yet and are placeholders
for future work on the framework and demos.

Enjoy!
