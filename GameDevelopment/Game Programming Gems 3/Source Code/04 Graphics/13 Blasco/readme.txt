This is the source code for the Surface Simulation Gem. 

In the TestModel dir you can find a simple model to test with.
Also in the Help dir you can find a simple html which explains the user interface of the max plugin.

In order to use the plugin, place it (NormalMapGen.dlo) in the Plugins directory in your Max installation folder (for example: c:\3dsmax4\plugins\).
