		<H1>A System for Managing Game Entities</H1>
		<H2><EM>Matthew Harmon - eV Interactive Corporation<BR>

		<H2>Source Code Overview</H2>
		<P class="Gems4Text">The code included on this CD outlines a skeleton entity 
			management system in C. It is not meant to be operational, but rather provide a 
			framework on which a complete package can be built, and a design to which a 
			C++, C# or Java implementation can be crafted. The typecasting, switch 
			statements and function pointers in this C implementation look a little dated, 
			but they should serve as an example of how a powerful entity system can be 
			created in any language.&nbsp;</P>
		<P class="Gems4Heading2"><STRONG>Moving To C++<BR>
			</STRONG>A message-based entity system becomes simpler and easier to maintain 
			when programmed in a language with support for classes and virtual functions. 
			Entity classes implement the necessary functions derived from a robust base 
			class. Sending a direct message is a simple matter of calling a member 
			function. Sending a message to the entire entity tree is somewhat more complex, 
			but manageable.&nbsp;</P>
		<P>While creating an entity could be as simple as using the <FONT face="Courier">new</FONT>
			operator on the derived class, it is still useful to maintain a class registry 
			so entities can be created by textual name. This reduces source-file 
			dependencies and allows entities to create and manipulate each other without 
			any knowledge of their class definition.</P>
		<H2>Manifest</H2>
		<P><STRONG>EntityManager.c / h</STRONG><BR>
			This file contains the basic entity manager framework, including the class list 
			manager and entity management code.&nbsp; In this example, entities are kept in 
			a simple tree.</P>
		<P><STRONG>EntityUtilities.c / h<BR>
			</STRONG>Contains examples of basic functions that may be performed on entities 
			in a generic manner.</P>
		<P><STRONG>Entities.h</STRONG><BR>
			Contains prototypes for all the entitiy procedures used in a game.</P>
		<P><STRONG>EntityMissile.c<BR>
			</STRONG>This is a sample entity module that can be used as a framework for 
			more complex entities.&nbsp;</P>
		<P><STRONG>EntityNull.c</STRONG><BR>
			A simple, do-nothing entity used for example purposes.&nbsp; Can also be used 
			as a placeholder node in a world tree.</P>
		<P><STRONG>EntityApp.c</STRONG><BR>
			A skeleton console application showing how to use the entity manager.</P>
		<P><STRONG>SystemStub.h</STRONG><BR>
			This stub code is provided to allow the examples to compile.&nbsp; It includes 
			elements such as vector operations that are used in the various sample files 
			but will most certainly be replaced by the user's custom code.</P>
		<P><STRONG>EntityManagerGem.dsw/dsp<BR>
			</STRONG>A VisualStudio workspace/project file that can be used to compile the 
			example code.</P>
