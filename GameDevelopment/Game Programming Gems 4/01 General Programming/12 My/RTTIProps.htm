This program has been compiled with Visual C++ 6 Service Pack 5, a VC 7.0 (.NET 2002) "solution" is also provided. 
<span class=highlight>DirectX 8.1</span> is used to render the 3D view and thus required. <BR>

The scene tree contains every object which is part of the current level : boxes, cameras, materials, nodes, spheres and textures. You can 
organize these objects the way you want by dragging them in the tree, and by grouping them in folders. This has no impact on the level 
itself.<BR><BR>
On the contrary the scene graph reflects how nodes (i.e. objects having a position and orientation) and objects derived from nodes 
(boxes, cameras, spheres, but not materials and textures) are hierarchically organized. By using drag and drop in the scene graph you can 
modify parent-child relationships between nodes.
<BR><BR><BR>

<a name="menu"></a>
<div class=titre2>Menu commands</div>
<BR>
The "File" menu allows you to create, load or save a level.<BR>
A new level only consists of a scene root and a default camera used to display the scene. You can add new objects with the 
"Scene view commands".<BR>
<BR>
When a level is saved, the following files are created :<BR>
- <i>MyLevel</i>.xml in the /Levels directory : this is the main file, which contains the path to the other files. 
This path is the name of the main file followed by a number : <i>MyLevel</i>.xml000, <i>MyLevel</i>.xml001, etc. 
The number is incremented each time the level is saved with the same name, so the old files are not overwritten and can be used as 
backups.<BR>
- PropDesc.bin and PropDesc.xml : these files hold the class descriptions, in binary and xml format.<BR>
- LevelData.bin and LevelData.xml : these files contain the data of the level's objects.<BR>
- logs.txt : the content of the log window is copied to this file, and the window is cleared. This is useful to reproduce the 
operations executed since the previous saving.<BR><BR>
When the level is loaded, an additional file is created : logs load.txt, which records information during the loading process and can 
be examined in case of failure.
<BR><BR><BR>

<a name="3dcomm"></a>
<div class=titre2>3D view commands</div>
<BR>
You can right-click on the 3D view to get a menu with a few commands or directly use their shortcuts when this view has the input focus.<BR>
- Move Camera : move the camera with the arrow keys or the mouse, and go forward / backward with page up / page down or the mouse buttons. 
You can validate your move by pressing enter, cancel it (but keep moving) with ctrl+Z, or exit this command with escape. 
Information about the current position is displayed in the status bar.<BR>
- Perpective : toggle between perspective and parallel projections. In parallel mode use + and - on the keypad to zoom in and out.<BR>
- Move Selection : move selected objects (displayed in wireframe) and their children while keeping the left button held down. You can 
limit your move to one axis with the ctrl and shift keys.
<BR><BR><BR>

<a name="gridcomm"></a>
<div class=titre2>Grid commands</div>
<BR>
There are 3 tabs in the property view : All, Editing, and <i>Object</i> (eg. Camera). This is because each type of object (camera, node, 
box...) in the sample is made of two parts : the "engine object", which contains the data needed by the game engine, and the "editor 
object", which adds other information only useful for tools. The Editing tab shows the properties of the editor object, the <i>Object</i> 
tab corresponds with the engine object, and All displays the properties of both parts.<BR><BR>
Only the 3rd column ("Value") is editable. When the cell has a yellow background, the property is read-only. Read-only properties can be 
hidden by using the "read-only props" button (top right). To modify a value in a text cell, double-click the cell and edit the value. 
Vectors (for example, the "Position" property) are floats separated by ";" and this syntax must be respected when entering new positions 
or directions.<BR><BR>
Buttons within grid cells are used to toggle boolean values between true and false, and to handle properties requiring special editing 
considerations. Several examples are given in the sample :<BR>
- objects derived from nodes own a Rotation property which is internally stored as a quaternion. However the user is asked to enter 
3 Euler angles to define a new orientation.<BR>
- each box and sphere references a material : the user can choose a new material from a list in a dialog box.<BR>
- in the sample a material has pointers to two textures : another dialog box is used, to show the existing textures in the level.<BR>
- a texture object loads its contents from a disk file : to choose this file a standard "open file" dialog is presented to the user. 
<BR><BR><BR>

<a name="scenecomm"></a>
<div class=titre2>Scene view commands</div>
<BR>
Right-click an item in the scene tree to get a list of supported commands. Most items can be renamed, boxes, spheres and cameras have a 
specific "edit" command which opens a dialog box, and all items allow to create new objects.<BR><BR>
When you create a new object you are prompted to give it a name, which must be unique. Boxes, spheres and cameras display a dialog box 
with default values you may want to modify (for example, the position), other objects are immediately added to the level. When the 
created object is a node or an object derived from node, it is attached to the scene root in the scene graph. You can use drag and drop 
to link it to another node in the graph.<BR>
Notice that positions and rotations in the grid control are relative to the parent node of the edited object.<BR><BR>
If you double-click a camera item, this camera becomes the one used to display the 3D view. If you see nothing it probably means 
that the camera is not looking at your objects but somewhere else (verify its properties in the grid control : by default objects are 
located at the world's origin so (0;0;0) is a good value for the camera target. By the way, the world's axes are x=right, y=top, z=towards 
you, this is a right-handed space).
<BR><BR><BR>

<a name="buttons"></a>
<div class=titre2>Other commands</div>
<BR>
The meaning of the 4 buttons above the scene graph is straightforward. However we haven't seen yet how to make or modify a selection. 
There are two different ways of doing it :<BR>
- to select / unselect an object you can edit it in the grid control : select it in the scene view, and change the value of its "Selected" 
property in the grid. Selected objects are displayed in wireframe.<BR>
- you can also use the check boxes in the scene view.<BR>
- of course in a real production tool it would be possible to choose objects by names, or in the 3D view.
<BR><BR>
In this sample the only thing you can do with a selection is to move it ; so selecting textures or other objects not derived from node is 
useless. <BR>
When the level is persisted, the "Selected" property is saved ; so it is easy to recreate the selection when re-loading a level.
<BR><BR><BR>

<a name="levels"></a>
<div class=titre2>Levels</div>
<BR>
A few levels are provided with this sample to demonstrate some concepts explained in the Gem. This is coder "art", so don't expect 
amazing graphics ;) 
Each level (except "sphere") is available in binary and 
xml format, the program creates both of them when you save a level. By default it reads the xml files when loading, there is a 
#define _LOAD_XML_ line to comment in RTTIPropsDoc.cpp if you want to change this behavior.<BR><BR>

* <span class=highlight>objects.xml</span> :<BR><BR>
this simple example contains the different types of objects available in the demonstration program. You can double-click the "top" and 
"default camera" cameras, and try to move them.<BR><BR>
If you move the current selection, you will see that the 3 cubes are linked to the wireframe sphere, as indicated in the scene graph. This 
can be verified in the persisted file Levels/objects.xml002/LevelData.xml too : look for the second CEngineSphere object 
(its name is "bottom right"), after its name and a flag the 3rd property tells us that this object has 3 children and gives us their IDs.<BR>
How does the executable know that the 3rd property is the list of children ? By reading PropDesc.xml in the same directory : 
CEngineSphere derives from CEngineNode, CEngineObj, CPersistent and finally CRefCount, and if we walk this class hierarchy from the 
base-most class (CRefCount) we see that the 3rd property of the CEngineSphere class is called "Subnodes" and inherited from 
CEngineNode. This property demonstrates how to stream a list of pointers, this is the example from the "Functions Properties" section 
of the Gem.<BR><BR>
All kinds of properties are used in this example, pointers being represented by the "SP" type (Smart Pointer). For example, each 
material (CEngineMaterial object) owns 2 pointers to textures, some are NULL and some are not. You can look for the referenced IDs to 
identify the pointed to objects : this is what the program does with an STL map during the linking phase.<BR><BR>

* <span class=highlight>objects_old.xml</span> :<BR><BR>
this is the same level as before, but in an old format : properties have been modified in the program since this file has been saved. By 
comparing the PropDesc.xml files we see the following differences between the old and current versions :<BR>
- in the CEngineNode class, "Draw Node" and "Collide" boolean properties have been added.<BR>
- in CEngineMaterial, the "Texture" and "TexOp" properties have been removed, and replaced by new "Tex0", "Tex1", "Op0" and "Op1" 
properties ; this is of course to manage 2 textures instead of one in the material.<BR>
- in CEngineTexture, the "Width", "Height" and "Depth" are not persisted anymore.<BR><BR>
Despite these changes, you can still load this level with the current executable. This demonstrates how the matching process described in 
the Gem helps reducing compatibility problems with old files.<BR><BR>
Notice that the central sphere is not textured : this is because the "Texture" property has been removed from the CEngineMaterial class. 
The new "Tex0" property does not exist in the file, so the corresponding material's pointer is NULL by default. You can re-assign the texture 
to the material in the grid control. This operation could have been avoided : instead of removing "Texture" and adding "Tex0" and "Tex1", 
"Tex1" could have been added to the already existing "Texture" property, thus ensuring that material-texture links are preserved.
<BR><BR>

* <span class=highlight>pacman.xml</span> :<BR><BR>
this level contains more objects and cameras, but you can see that PropDesc.xml is not bigger (which means that the matching phase does not 
take longer).
<BR><BR>

* <span class=highlight>sphere.xml</span> :<BR><BR>
this level contains the single sphere whose class' description and data is used in the Gem to illustrate the 
"Compatibility With Old Files" section.
<BR><BR><BR>

<a name="xml"></a>
<div class=titre2>XML compliance</div>
<BR>
The text files created by the sample are XML compliant, provided that they do not contain special characters reserved by this language. 
More precisely, <span class=highlight>& < > \ "</span> should be replaced by their corresponding escape sequences. To preserve XML 
compliance, you should not :<BR>
- use these characters in the property names.<BR>
- use these characters in the names of scene objects. The CDlgItemName class used to enter or modify the name of an object rejects these 
characters in its CDlgItemName::OnChangeName() method.
