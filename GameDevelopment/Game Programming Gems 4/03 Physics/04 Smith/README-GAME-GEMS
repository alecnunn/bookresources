-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the source code for ODE 0.039, for the GameGems IV CDROM. This
accompanies the GameGems chapter "Constraints in Rigid Body Dynamics".

An extra test program has been added (ode/test/test_joint_examples.cpp)
to demonstrate the constraints in the GameGems chapter. Refer to the
comments in that file for further information.

ODE is a free, industrial quality library for simulating articulated
rigid body dynamics - for example ground vehicles, legged creatures,
and moving objects in VR environments. It is fast, flexible, robust
and platform independent, with advanced joints, contact with friction,
and built-in collision detection.

For the most up-to-date version of ODE you can go to the web site at
  
  http://q12.org/ode

Installation instructions are in the INSTALL file

The ODE documentation is in the file ode/doc/ode.html, or you
can view it on the web at http://q12.org/ode/
