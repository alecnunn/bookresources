| A simple demonstration of back of the envelope aerodynamics. This demo
| simulates the flight of a simple, longitudinal airplane. This airplane
| is a canard style airplane, with the main wing in the rear and the
| smaller, horizontal stabilizer wing in the front.
|
| Keyboard controls:
|
|  'r' - restart the simulation, and put it in pause mode
|  'q' - quit the application
|  'g' - start the simulation, or take it out of pause mode
|  'p' - pause the simulation
|  '>' - increase simulation speed
|  '<' - decrease simulation speed
|  '+' - increase the incidence angle of the horizontal stabilizer
|  '-' - decrease the incidence angle of the horizontal stabilizer
|  'l' - toggle C.G. lock. When C.G. is locked, only rotational
|        motion of airplane is simulated. Otherwise, rotation and
|        translation is simulated. Default is unlocked.
