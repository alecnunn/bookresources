INTRODUCTION
The software in this package constitutes a sample program
that is intended to demonstrate the principles discussed 
in the articles:
  
  Precise Game Event Broadcasting with Python
  Creating a "Safe Sandbox" for Game Scripting

In the accompanying book, "Massively Multiplayer Game Development".

The two articles were originally written as independent
representations, but in constructing the sample program, it
became clear that both concepts would benefit from a consistent
treatment within the same code base. 

The source code for this package can be found on the this CD-ROM under:

	\Source Code\2.3 Safe Sandbox\
