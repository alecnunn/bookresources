;This is the tile texture
tex t0

;This is a little unnecessarily convoluted.
;The diffuse lighting factor (v1) is multiplied by the
;smudge factor in the alpha channel of the texture.
;After that, an ambient lighting value (v0) is added.
mad r0, v1, t0.a, v0

;Multiply the complete lighting factor by the texture
;to get the final output (r0)
