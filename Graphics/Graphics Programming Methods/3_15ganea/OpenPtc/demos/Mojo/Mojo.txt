wait! stop! read!
a little demo made for gaffer for his great ptc package
an old effect I made for a demo with basehead
but it never got made
the only truecolour effect I made to date :)
time to move on I guess...

THIS IS NOT TESTED AT ALL! I've run it on 1 machine (mine) under 1 video
mode under one compiler (dos, watcom, 10.6, release). so. erm. sorry
if it don't work, it aint ptc's fault O:-)

so, no responsibility taken for this code or any of its effects, blah blah
read it and weep - it's HORRIBLE! it was real hack-around with it until
it looks ok type code. but it does look ok, on a p2... (well, I have a p90
ok?)

it used to be processor independent on speed... no longer. but hey. I dont
care. just watch it in slowmo!

just a note about ptc...
it's really neat! I unzipped the package, read 0% docs, read 5% example
source code and put it in, in only 40 minutes, starting from the ftp.
it compiled and ran perfectly, first time. (ptc that is :))
that has to be the easiest (large) piece of code I've ever had to drop in.
congrats are due to the man gaffer!
