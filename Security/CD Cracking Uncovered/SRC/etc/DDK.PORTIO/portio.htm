<h2><a NAME="MYSAMPLE">PORTIO</a> </h2>

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
</font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">

<p>This generic port I/O device driver sample shows how to reserve I/O ports and read and
write to it from an user application. </p>

<p>The driver building and installation instructions given here only apply to Windows&reg; 2000.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: This sample provides an example of a minimal driver. Neither it nor its
sample programs are intended for use in a production environment. Rather, they are
intended for educational purposes and as a skeleton driver.</p>

<h3>BUILDING THE SAMPLE</h3>

<p>Click the Free Build Environment or Checked Build Environment icon under your 
<b>Developement Kits </b> program group to set basic environment variables needed 
by the build utility. </p>

<p>Change to the directory containing the device source code, such as CD
Src\General\Portio. </p>

<p>Run <b>build -ceZ</b>, or use the macro <b>BLD</b>. This behavior invokes the Microsoft
make routines that produce log files called Buildxxx.log, and also Buildxxx.wrn and Buildxxx.err if
there are any warnings or errors. Where xxx stands for <b>fre</B> or <b>chk</b> depending
on the environment chosen. If the build succeeds, the driver Genport.sys and two application
GpdRead.exe and GpdWrite will be placed in a platform specific subdirectory of your
<b>%TargetPath%</b> directory specified in the Sources file.</p>

<h4>Driver Installation </h4>

<p>To install the driver: 

<ol>
  <li>Double-click the Add/Remove Hardware Wizard applet in Control Panel.</li>
  <li>Select Add/Troubleshoot a Device.</li>
  <li>Select Add a new device.</li>
  <li>Select No, I Want to Select the Hardware from a list.</li>
  <li>Select Other Devices and then click Next. </li>
  <li>Click Have Disk and point to the directory that contains genport.inf file.</li>
</ol>

<p>The system copies the genport.sys file to %systemroot%\system32\drivers directory and
loads the driver. The INF file specifies two logical configuartion for the device.</p>

<p><br>
[PortIO.LC0]<br>
ConfigPriority=DESIRED <br>
IOConfig=300-303(3ff::) ; 10 bit decode ranging from 300 - 303<br>
<br>
[PortIO.LC1]<br>
ConfigPriority=NORMAL<br>
IOConfig=4@300-3ff(3ff::) ; 4 ports starting anywhere between 300 and 3fc<br>
</p>

<p>The system will first try to assing the DESIRED configuration. If there is conflict
then it will try to assign any 4 consecutive port between 300 and 3fc as specified in the
LC1 configuration.</p>

<h3>TOOLS</h3>

<p>To test your GENPORT driver, do the following.</p>

<p>GpdRead -b 1 {This reads a byte from assingned 'base port address + 1' } </p>

<p>GpdWrite -b 2 1 {This writes 1 to assigned 'base port address + 2' } </p>
